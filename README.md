# decimal_clock
a clock with units based of 100

Are you also annoyed that 
- 1 day has 24 hours
- 1 hour has 60 minutes
- 1 minute has 60 seconds
- 1 second has 100 milliseconds

it would be so much simpler if: 

- 1 day has 100 phils
- 1 phil has 100 phillys
- 1 philly has 100 miniphils
- 1 miniphil has 100 milliphils
- 1 milliphil has 100 microphils

well, then this is the code for you.
